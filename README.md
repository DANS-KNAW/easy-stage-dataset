easy-stage-dataset
==================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DANS-KNAW/easy-stage-dataset.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DANS-KNAW/easy-stage-dataset)

Stage a dataset in EASY-BagIt format for ingest into an EASY Fedora Commons 3.x Repository.


SYNOPSIS
--------

    easy-stage-dataset -t <submission-timestamp> -u <urn> -d <doi> [ -o ] [ -f <external-file-uris> ] [-a <archive>] \
                              <EASY-deposit> <staged-digital-object-set>

    easy-stage-file-item [<options>...] <staged-digital-object-set>


DESCRIPTION
-----------

Datasets that are to be archived in EASY are initially received as *deposits* through the [easy-sword2] service. These
deposits must conform to [BagIt] format.

To prepare the deposit for inclusion in EASY `easy-stage-dataset` performs the following tasks:

 1. It generates the metadata required for an EASY dataset:
    * Administrative Metadata
    * EASY Metadata (descriptive metadata)
 2. It stages a digital object to represent the entire dataset for ingest in Fedora, using the metadata generated in 1.
 3. It stages a digital object for each file and folder in the dataset for ingest in Fedora.

The results of steps 1-3 can be ingested into the EASY Fedora Commons Repository. See the wiki section
about the [export-import] cycle as `easy-export-dataset` also creates Staged Digital Objects.

References to files in external storage such as audio/video files can be added to existing datasets with 
the command `easy-stage-file-item`. It executes step 3 to stage one or more files for ingestion.

INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION
------------------------------
Currently this project is built as an RPM package for RHEL7/CentOS7 and later. The RPM will install the binaries to
`/opt/dans.knaw.nl/easy-stage-dataset` and the configuration files to `/etc/opt/dans.knaw.nl/easy-stage-dataset`. 

To install the module on systems that do not support RPM, you can copy and unarchive the tarball to the target host.
You will have to take care of placing the files in the correct locations for your system yourself. For instructions
on building the tarball, see next section.


BUILDING FROM SOURCE
--------------------

Prerequisites:

* Java 8 or higher
* Maven 3.3.3 or higher
* RPM
 
Steps:

        git clone https://github.com/DANS-KNAW/easy-stage-dataset.git
        cd easy-stage-dataset
        mvn install

If the `rpm` executable is found at `/usr/local/bin/rpm`, the build profile that includes the RPM 
packaging will be activated. If `rpm` is available, but at a different path, then activate it by using
Maven's `-P` switch: `mvn -Pprm install`.

Alternatively, to build the tarball execute:

    mvn clean install assembly:single
